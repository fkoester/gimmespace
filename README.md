Command line tool for reporting parking violations (e.g. parking on bike lanes) to the public order office(s) (in Germany).

## Status

**Warning:** The code is currently in a proof-of-concept state for personal use and needs some serious refactoring.

I don't recommend using it at all. Instead please use the following projects with a similar goal:

* http://wegeheld.org/ (App for Android and iOS)
* https://stadtpate.de/ (Mobile friendly web app)
